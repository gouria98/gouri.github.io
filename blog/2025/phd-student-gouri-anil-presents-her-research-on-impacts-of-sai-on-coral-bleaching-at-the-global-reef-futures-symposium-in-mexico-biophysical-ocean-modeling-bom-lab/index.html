Reef Futures is the only global symposium focused solely on the interventions and actions necessary to allow coral reefs to thrive into the next century.  Solar Climate Intervention has been suggested as a potential tool to aid emission reductions in achieving temperature targets to mitigate climate change impacts. While climate intervention has potential benefits, it is essential to predict and estimate ecosystem impacts for informed decision making. With her research, Gouri assesses the impacts of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) on coral reefs. She used Earth System Model simulation daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to project and compare spatial and temporal patterns of bleaching between a future moderate emissions climate scenario with and without intervention using Stratospheric Aerosol Injection. The projections are made for marine ecoregion provinces with coral reefs to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the potential benefits or risks of implementing SAI on a vulnerable ecosystem like coral reefs. Her research shows that using SAI to limit global warming to 1.5°C over the preindustrial period could significantly reduce global coral bleaching in the future.She had the opportunity to share her findings with international researchers as well as collaborators working on related projects. She has previously shared her findings at the Ocean Sciences Meeting 2024 in New Orleans. You must be logged in to post a comment.</p> </body></html>
