Here is the abstract:Rising global temperatures pose significant risks to marine ecosystems, biodiversity and fisheries. Recent comprehensive assessments suggest that large-scale mitigation efforts to limit warming are falling short, and all feasible future climate projections, including those that represent optimistic emissions reductions, exceed the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C or 2º warming targets during this century. While avoiding further CO2 emissions remains the most effective way to prevent environmental destabilization, interest is growing in climate interventions – deliberate, large-scale manipulations of the environment aimed at reducing global warming. These include carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time, and solar radiation modification (SRM), which reflects sunlight to lower surface temperatures but does not address root CO2 causes. The effects of these interventions on marine ecosystems, both direct and in combination with ongoing climate change, remain highly uncertain. Given the ocean’s central role in regulating Earth’s climate and supporting global food security, understanding these potential effects is crucial. This review provides an overview of proposed intervention methodologies for marine CDR and SRM and outlines the potential trade-offs and knowledge gaps associated with their impacts on marine ecosystems. Climate interventions have the potential to reduce warming-driven impacts, but could also alter marine food systems, biodiversity and ecosystem function. Effects will vary by pathway, scale, and regional context. Pathway-specific impact assessments are thus crucial to quantify trade-offs between plausible intervention scenarios as well as to identify their expected impacts on marine ecosystems in order to prioritize scaling efforts for low-risk pathways and avoid high-risk scenarios.Gouri Anil studied the impacts of SAI on aragonite saturation and coral reefs. The figure represents Aragonite saturation state (Ωarag), a key measure of the ocean’s ability to support calcium carbonate structures like coral reefs. In the pre-industrial period, most shallow-water reefs were surrounded by high saturation states (Ωarag &gt; 3.25), which has declined due to increasing ocean acidification. Under Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), the Ωarag levels are even lower than that under climate change. This is due to the increased absorption of carbon dioxide by cooler oceans. The contour lines represent the extent of ideal aragonite saturation state values and there is a stark difference between the present and the future under both climate change and intervention, with a limited number of reefs existing within the ideal.This paper also uses a schematic that highlights the Climate Intervention Methods and a Communication schematic created by Vanessa van Heerden from Louisiana Sea Grant to enhance communication    You must be logged in to post a comment.</p> </body></html>
